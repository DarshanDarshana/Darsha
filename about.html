        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            HOPE PAY is a secure digital payment platform designed for families. The project integrates MySQL for data
            management, Firebase Firestore for real-time transaction logging, and various modern web technologies to
            provide an intuitive user experience. Its primary goal is to enable seamless, secure transactions between
            parents and children.

        <h3>Children Safety</h3>
        <p>
            Safety is a top priority. Parents can create child accounts with preset daily spending limits. If a child
            attempts to exceed these limits, the system automatically sends an email for parental confirmation, ensuring
            every transaction is monitored and approved.
